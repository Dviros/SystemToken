# SystemToken

This code will iterate over all processes on a system until it reaches a process with
the following traits:

* The user for that process is SYSTEM
* The owner for that process is Administrators

Once a process is found with these two traits, the token for that process is duplicated and
a new process with that token is created. This will result in a SYSTEM shell. 

## System Requirements

This code was tested on a Windows 10 x64 machine using Visual Studio 2019.  
Must be run with UAC bypassed and Local Admin privileges.

## Usage

Compile and run SystemToken.exe
